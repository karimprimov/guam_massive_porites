In this script, I include code for demultiplexing, trimming, generating multi-locus genotypes, and running population genomic analyses. This code includes examples of each step in the Linux bioinformatic and R pipeline. This code was produced to study the population genomics of a morphologically convergent coral species group called massive Porites. Found throughout the Indo-Pacific, they occur in different reef environments, and in this study, we find that different species,not populations of the same species, predominantly occupy river deltas and adjacent (< 100M) fore reefs on Guam respectively, and bleaching less prevalent in river deltas.
